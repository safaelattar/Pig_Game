      <h2>The rules of the game</h2>
      <p>- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.</p>
      <p>
        - In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each
        result get added to his ROUND score.
      </p>
      <p>
        - BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After
        that, it's the next player's turn.
      </p>
      <p>
        - The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets
        added to his GLBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn.
      </p>
      <p>
        - The first player to reach at least 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the
        game.
